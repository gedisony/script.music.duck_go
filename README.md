music duck go - Kodi Screensaver
==============================

  Animate results from an image search onto your screen.<br>
  Quickly create a screensaver based on your favorite character, movie or theme.<br>
  The main idea is to have many images flying on the screen to keep things interesting.<br>

## Features

## Notes for 'Settings' - 'No music' - 'Search template' 
 * Text entered here is similar to doing image search on [DuckDuckGo](https://api.duckduckgo.com/?q=kodi&iar=images&iax=1&ia=images)
 * Each search returns 50 images. Use special commands to get more than 50.
 * Special commands are placed in brackets [ ]  e.g.:  `universe[pages=3]`
 * If the search term is too specific, less than 50 images will be returned.
 * `[terms=cake,fruit]` will search for 'cake' and 'fruit' returning 100 images
 * `[terms=cake,fruit] dessert` will search for 'cake dessert' and 'fruit dessert'
